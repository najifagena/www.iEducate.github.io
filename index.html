            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves. Education can take
                place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one
                thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship. In most regions, education is
                compulsory up to a certain age.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda listâ€¦
                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which
                almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a
                practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.
                I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else
                it might turn out to be too late.
                Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.
                The blend of the two terminologies refers to the modification of pedagogic practices. The transformation
                of education became an integral part of the process in upliftment and empowerment of human beings.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary
                in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
                Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to
                extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education
                developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.
                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece.
